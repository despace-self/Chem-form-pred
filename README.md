ðŸš€ Predicting Chemical Formulas with Symbolic Regression! ðŸ”¬

Most machine learning models work like black boxesâ€”but what if we could derive actual mathematical expressions instead? Thatâ€™s exactly what I did using Symbolic Regression to predict chemical formulas from the Pitt Quantum Repository (PQR) dataset!

PQR is the largest open database of molecular quantum calculations, leveraging PM6 semiempirical quantum models from MOPAC. Instead of traditional ML techniques, I used Symbolic Regression, which doesnâ€™t just fit dataâ€”it uncovers interpretable equations describing the underlying patterns in quantum chemistry.

ðŸš€ Why Symbolic Regression?
âœ… Generates human-readable formulas instead of black-box models
âœ… Helps uncover hidden relationships in molecular data
âœ… More transparent and generalizable for quantum chemistry applications

By fine-tuning the feature selection using Mutual Information (MI) scores, I optimized the model across multiple thresholds:

âœ… Train MAE: 1292.57
âœ… Test MAE: 1256.57
âœ… Train RÂ²: 0.946
âœ… Test RÂ²: 0.954

This approach has exciting applications in molecular design, materials science, and computational chemistry! Would love to connect with researchers and data scientistsâ€”what are your thoughts on using symbolic regression in scientific discovery? ðŸš€ðŸ”¬
